# EmpiricalRiskMinimization.jl Docs

EmpiricalRiskMinimization.jl is a Julia package which carries out numerical optimization 
required to solved regularized empirical risk minimization problems. These problems 
are found in numerous applications, including machine learning, control, computer vision, and 
many more disciplines. The focus of this package is to provide easy-to-use interfaces, 
putting the focus on finding the right model to use, rather than the one which may be cleanest 
to implement.
